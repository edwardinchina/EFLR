## TODO
# Big idea

  * Done
2. Tagged by Level
  * Need to use hash tables.
  * Regex strings (used by mark.js) are to slow and are limited in size.


# important features
1. Realtime editing
  * Fast
  * All input events accounted for
2. Choosing sources of frequency data.
  * It's easy to build in some options.
  * Pasting in data is already working.

# Why this project is important
1. Editors and word processors are being reimagined.
2. Grammarly, AutoCrit, and distraction free editors are very popular and lucrative.
3. Personally this will help me and my children to learn to read (and possibly type) Chinese.
4. Finishing something will mean a lot to me.
